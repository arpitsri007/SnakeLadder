Snake and Ladder is a simple board game that involves:

	•	A board with numbered squares.
	•	Snakes that move the player down.
	•	Ladders that move the player up.
	•	Dice to determine the number of steps a player can move.
	•	Players take turns to roll the dice and move on the board based on the dice outcome.


Design Considerations

	1.	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class should have a single responsibility.
	2.	Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	3.	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
	4.	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
	5.	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.


Classes and Design Patterns

	1.	Player: Represents a player in the game.
	2.	Board: Represents the game board, containing the positions of snakes and ladders.
	3.	Dice: Represents the dice used to play the game.
	4.	Game: Manages the game flow.
	5.	Cell: Represents a cell on the board which can be a normal cell, a snake head, or a ladder bottom.
	6.	Snake and Ladder: Represent snakes and ladders on the board.

Design Patterns:

	•	Factory Pattern: Used to create instances of Cell (Snake, Ladder, or Normal).
	•	Strategy Pattern: For implementing different strategies of the game like deciding the winner based on different rules.
